;; Testing proper queue rotation (see issue #3 on github)
;; ------------------------------------------------------
;; When doing a "rotation", ie reversing the rear list and appending that to 
;; the end of the front list, the reverse operation should be delayed and only
;; forced when that section of the front list is needed.

;; To demonstrate, build a queue of size 2^n - 2. Taking the tail of this queue
;; triggers a rotation. In a proper implementation, the reversing is delayed 
;; so the tail operation should be instantaneous (ie should take 0 time).
(define (assert e p) (if (p e) e (error 'assert)))
;; n = 21
(let ([q (build-queue (assert (- (expt 2 21) 2) positive?) add1)])
  (time (tail q)))

;; 2013-03-10, on Steve's desktop (i7-2600k, 16GB), in drracket
;; (I dont know why the gc time is so high, probably an anomaly, but the
;;  important number is 0 after the fix)
;; before fix: cpu time: 468 real time: 469 gc time: 400
;;  after fix: cpu time: 0 real time: 0 gc time: 0


;; Another way to expose premature rotation is to manipulate a queue into a
;; state such that the next tail operation forces the reversing thunk. If the
;; reversing was done prematurely, then taking the tail of this queue will be
;; instantaneous. But in a proper implementation, taking the tail should be an
;; expensive operation.

;; To get such a queue, build a queue of size 2^n - 2 and then drop the first
;; 2^(n-1) - 1 elements (ie, half). In a proper implementation, taking the tail
;; of this queue should be an expensive operation in a correct implementation.

;; n = 21, 2^21 - 2 = 2097150; 2^20 - 1 = 1048575

       [thresh (sub1 (expt 2 (sub1 n)))])
  (let loop ([q (build-queue (assert (- (expt 2 n) 2) positive?) add1)] 
             [i 0])
    (if (< i thresh)
        (loop (tail q) (add1 i))
        (time (tail q)))))

;; Testing queues used persistently (assumes fixed issue#3, described above)
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; To maintain constant, amortized time operations when the queue is used 
;; persistently, doing an expensive rotation should memoize the result so that
;; repeating the same expensive operation completes instantaneously.

;; This is the same as the second example above, except the "expensive" tail
;; is called twice. The second call should be instantaneous.
