;; NOTE:
;; Rebalancing used in Okasaki version of Red Black Trees is slightly
;; different from that of popular version. 
;; As a consequence of this difference,
;; - Okasaki version is easy to implement.
;; - There is a difference in ordering of elements. For example, in the 
;;   test below, popular version would give (list 2 3 4 1 5). Because 
;;   redblacktree->list  takes the root element in the red-black tree and 
;;   populates it in a list and then deletes the root element. When it 
;;   deletes the root node, balancing is done, since the balancing differs 
;;   in Okasaki version, 4 becomes the root of the tree instead of 3 which
;;   is the case in the popular version.
