Functional Data Structures for Typed Racket
===========================================

This library provides several functional data structures based on the work
of Chris Okasaki and Phil Bagwell.

The original library was implemented by Hari Prashanth.

The following data structures are implemented:

*  Deques
   +  Bankers Deque
   +  Implicit Deque
   +  Real-Time Deque
*  Heaps
   +  Binomial Heap
   +  Skew Binomial Heap
   +  Leftist Heap
   +  Splay Heap
   +  Pairing Heap
   +  Lazy Pairing Heap
   +  Bootstrapped Heap
*  Random Access Lists
   +  Binary Random Access List
   +  Skew Binary Random Access List
*  Catenable List
*  VList
*  Streams
*  Red-Black Trees
*  Tries
*  Sets
*  Treap
